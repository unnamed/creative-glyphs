    # How to generate the resource pack
    # -> file:filename
    #     -> Generates a resource pack as a file (ZIP)
    # -> mergezipfile:filename
    #     -> Similar to file:filename but if the file exists,
    #        it will merge the contents instead of overwriting
    #        them (ZIP)
    # -> into:folderName
    #     -> Writes the resource pack as files into the given
    #        folder name, if it doesn't start with '/', it will
    #        be inside the plugin (unemojis/) folder, if it
    #        starts with '@', it will be inside the plugins folder
    #        Examples:
    #        -> @OtherPlugin/resourcepack
    #        -> /home/user/server/resourcepack/
    #        -> resourcepack
    # -> mcpacks
    #     -> Uses https://mc-packs.net/ to upload the result,
    #        it's a free resource-pack host, you can donate to
    #        them :)
